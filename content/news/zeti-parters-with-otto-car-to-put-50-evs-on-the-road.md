Zeti, a leading innovator in the clean transport sector, today announced its fintech platform is powering the deployment of 50 Kia Niro electric cars for Otto Car Limited, Europe’s largest provider of electric vehicles to private-hire drivers.

Otto Car collaborates with ride-hailing platforms like UBER, leading the charge in vehicle electrification and fostering a community of over 10,000 drivers. Drivers enjoy the advantages of a flexible partnership, supportive community, comprehensive claims and licensing management.

**“As the UK's largest private hire fleet, we are tech-enabled and growing rapidly. Zeti's fintech platform gives us deep real-time insights into our assets' financing which is valuable data we will use to fuel our expansion beyond our 5000-strong zero-emission fleet in London. We are delighted to partner with Zeti for their financial technology and the MEEF fund to accelerate the roll out of clean vehicles in London.”**

These vehicles are funded by The Mayor of London’s Energy Efficiency Fund (‘MEEF’), managed by Amber Fund Management Limited (‘Amber’) through Zeti’s digital platform. Since launching in July 2018, MEEF has made investments in electric vehicles, EV charging, district heating, streetlighting and energy efficiency sectors creating energy savings of over 40 GWh.

**"We are delighted to work together with Zeti and Otto Car to support this innovative approach to financing, and in doing so, helping to accelerate the shift from conventional to electric vehicles in the Capital."
Peter Radford, Director of MEEF, Amber**

**"I am delighted to see further steps being taken to build a better, greener London for everyone. The investment from the Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund will support the partnership between Zeti and Otto as we accelerate the switch to electric vehicles. It is a fantastic way to tackle air pollution and reduce the city’s carbon emissions to help us reach the Mayor’s net zero target by 2030.”**

**\- Shirley Rodrigues, Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy**

Zeti stands at the forefront of the shift towards clean transport by leveraging real-time financial data to accelerate the availability of funding for zero and ultra-low emission vehicles, helping operators looking to decarbonise their fleets and achieve net zero targets.

**"Adding Otto Car as a client is an exciting moment in Zeti's growth story. Otto are the largest and most technologically advanced PCO fleet in the UK by far; the partnership signals the value of the Zeti fintech platform to major fleets, bringing real value and insights that keep fleet financing costs to a minimum. We are pleased to deliver for Otto both financing through the Mayor's fund and our fintech platform that will play a part in the growth of such a successful business".**
