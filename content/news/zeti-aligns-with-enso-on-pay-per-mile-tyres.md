Zeti was featured in Autocar magazine as the financial technology to facilitate pay-per-mile tyres for EV's.

These range-extending tyres are manufactured by ENSO and are designed for targeted use on EV's. A pilot of these tyres is underway on 100 LEVC TX vehicles and be carried out this year.

We are proud to be partnering with our friends over at ENSO and look forward to being part of providing the world's first pay-per-mile subscription model for tyres.
