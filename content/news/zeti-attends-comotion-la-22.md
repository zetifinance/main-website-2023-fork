F﻿rom Tuesday 15th - Thursday 17th November, our CEO, Dan Saunders and our CTO, Dan Bass headed out to LA to attend CoMotion 2022. They were met by our Director of Strategic Partnerships, Rebecca Saletta, herself based in LA, who joined them at the 3 day event.\
\
I﻿t was a chance for Zeti to celebrate our contributions to the future of mobility but also meet other key stakeholders focused on zero-emission technologies. Dan Saunders was asked to open the keynote fireside chats alongside host, John Rossant to speak about how the business has evolved since its conception 4 years ago.
