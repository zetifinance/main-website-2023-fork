      rich_editor: >-
        We’re evolving traditional auto-finance and giving fleets the resources
        to transition to zero and ultra-low-emission vehicles without hidden
        fees and huge monthly charges, and in a way that aligns with their cash
        flow. In order to grow our product, we need a team focused on striving
        towards a greener future through innovation. 


        We’re hiring talented and creative problem-solvers to do just that.

        also operates in California and New York. We’re on a mission to reduce

        ultra-low vehicles whilst also offering institutional lenders the option
        to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns in a new, clean asset
        class.

          them.

          * Firstly, we will review your application. Please make sure to
          include anything that you think will help us decide if you are right
          for the role and any reasonable adjustments you require. If we think
          you might be a good fit we will progress to the first interview.

          * The first interview will be digital, with 1-2 members of Zeti staff, likely including the hiring manager for the role. Our objective with this interview is to clear up any queries about your application and evaluate your suitability for the next stage of the process.

          * The next stage is a take-home test. You must complete this yourself, and you will be tested on its contents in the next interview. The structure and rules of this test varies between departments, but this will be clearly communicated with you when you are invited to complete it. Any questions are welcome, and we’d rather you ask than not (some tasks will naturally have questions that we cannot answer, but we’ll tell you if that’s the case). 

          * Final interview, this will be carried out usually with a wider and different selection of people and will have two halves. One half will focus on feedback for your take-home test, and the other half will be a more wide-ranging interview. They may happen in any order, depending on availability. 

          * You start working to revolutionize transport finance for good!
