      rich_editor: Introducing an innovative new financing tool to accelerate sales.
        Zeti acts as a sales enablement tool for vehicle manufacturers and
        dealerships, providing an attractive customer-centric option to add to
        your existing financing options.

            options
          rich_editor: Fleets want the ability to pay as they drive, rather than fixed
            repayments. Being able to offer your vehicles to be financed per
            mile provides an attractive alternative financing solution,
            increasing the chances of you completing the sale.

          heading: Transparency
          rich_editor: Current leasing relies on heavy discounts being provided by vehicle
            manufacturers but rarely being passed onto from the customer. Zeti
            keeps everything transparent. If you choose to offer discounts then
            that is to the benefit of your customer, not an intermediary.

          rich_editor: Our focus is to accelerate the adoption of zero emission vehicles.
            We appreciate that zero-emission technologies may not be applicable
            to all vehicle types and industries just yet. Therefore we also
            support ultra-low emission vehicles. We seek to boost the sales of
            your clean vehicles, helping you fulfil your emissions obligations
            without harming your sales.
