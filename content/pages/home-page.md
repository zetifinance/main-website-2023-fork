              sales**


              Zeti acts as a sales enablement tool to boost zero-emission vehicle sales by allowing your fleet customers the option of paying per mile for vehicle finance, rather than having a fixed monthly cost. Zeti’s software can also be used to deploy your in-house finance, enabling you to offer your own pay-per-mile solution.
