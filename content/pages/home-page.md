              **Introducing an innovative new financing tool to accelerate
              sales**


              Zeti acts as a sales enablement tool to boost zero-emission vehicle sales by allowing your fleet customers the option of paying per mile for vehicle finance, rather than having a fixed monthly cost. Zeti’s software can also be used to deploy your in-house finance, enabling you to offer your own pay-per-mile solution.

            "A particular benefit of the Zeti Invest platform is the pooling of
            vehicle mileage; with a contracted aggregate mileage across all
            vehicles, we don’t need to juggle individual cabs to a fixed mileage
            or end date."

            "As the UK's largest private hire fleet, we are tech-enabled and
            growing rapidly. Zeti's fintech platform gives us deep real-time
            insights into our assets' financing which is valuable data we will
            use to fuel our expansion beyond our 5000-strong zero-emission fleet
            in London. We are delighted to partner with Zeti for their financial
            technology and the MEEF fund to accelerate the roll out of clean
            vehicles in London.”
