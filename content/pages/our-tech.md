      heading: FAQs
    accordions:
      - heading: How is data protection managed and is Zeti Hub GDPR-compliant?
        rich_editor: >-
          Zeti processes and stores personal data about Zeti Hub users from
          customer organisations, and in this respect, it is subject to GDPR.
          Our Technology and Operations teams follow a robust policy to handle
          this data.


          It is worth noting that Zeti does not currently store or process personal data about the drivers or rental customers of fleet operators, who themselves are customer organisations. Therefore, GDPR does not apply in this respect.
      - heading: How much does Zeti Hub cost?
        rich_editor: At the moment, the cost of Zeti Hub is included in the origination
          and service fees payable by lenders on contracts facilitated by Zeti
          as an organisation.
      - heading: What software does and can Zeti Hub integrate with?
        rich_editor: Zeti Hub integrates with a number of different types of services in
          order to digitise and automate key automotive processes. These range
          from telematics suppliers (e.g. GeoTab) payment processing engines
          (e.g. Stripe), public vehicle maintenance databases (e.g. the UK
          government's Department for Transport's MOT API) and residual value
          databases (e.g. Black Book). We continue to add further integrations
          to improve the customer experience for our lenders and fleet
          operators.
      - heading: Who does Zeti use for payment processing?
        rich_editor: Zeti Hub primarily uses Stripe for payment processing, with
          additional integrations built to providers like GoCardless.
      - heading: How does Zeti track vehicles?
        rich_editor: When vehicles are deployed as part of a contract that Zeti is
          managing, either a hardware-based or software-only telematics solution
          is implemented in order to understand utilisation, location and asset
          status. This provides both lenders and fleet operators with a number
          of advantages including utilisation-based financing, financial and
          sustainability reporting, residual value and battery health
          monitoring, but to name a few.
