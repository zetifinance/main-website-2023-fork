        Transport is becoming an on-demand service. Fleet operators need to
        adopt low or zero-emission vehicles; whether due to customer demand,
        legislative requirements, or simply because it’s the right thing to do. 


        However, financing is expensive and often disconnected from revenue generation, not to mention the hidden costs and penalties sometimes found with traditional leasing. 


        Zeti’s pay-per-mile financing optimizes your cash flow and can help secure your profit margin.

          heading: Pay-per-mile
          rich_editor: We offer true pay-per-mile vehicle fleet financing; pooled across
            the fleet, rather than per vehicle. There is no penalty for driving
            over your estimated monthly mileage. Our contracts are based on a
            contracted mileage commitment and allow for flexible payments.

          rich_editor: Billing and payment collection are entirely automated and always
            available on our dedicated Fleet Operator portal. For your ease of
            use, check any historic information whenever you like in your
            dedicated portal.

          heading: No hidden costs
          rich_editor: Unlike traditional fixed-duration finance with estimated mileage,
            having a fixed contracted mileage means the total cost of ownership
            is always accurate and transparent. You pay for what you’ve used.

          heading: Sustainability focused
          rich_editor: Our focus is to accelerate the adoption of zero emission vehicles.
            We appreciate that zero-emission technologies may not be applicable
            to all vehicle types and industries just yet. Therefore we also
            support ultra-low emission vehicles. We seek to boost adoption of
            clean vehicles but won’t dictate the underlying clean technology to
            be used.

            "As the UK's largest private hire fleet, we are tech-enabled and
            growing rapidly. Zeti's fintech platform gives us deep real-time
            insights into our assets' financing which is valuable data we will
            use to fuel our expansion beyond our 5000-strong zero-emission fleet
            in London. We are delighted to partner with Zeti for their financial
            technology and the MEEF fund to accelerate the roll out of clean
            vehicles in London."

            "A particular benefit of the Zeti Invest platform is the pooling of
            vehicle mileage; with a contracted aggregate mileage across all
            vehicles, we don’t need to juggle individual cabs to a fixed mileage
            or end date."

          We work with lenders seeking to invest in clean transport; unlocking
          new pools of capital as well as leveraging traditional pools. Lenders
          may include banks, insurance firms, pension funds, family offices,
          etc. 


          Zeti turns transportation into a new clean asset class and is therefore able to support a wide range of lenders as they seek to add zero-emission vehicles to their portfolios.
      - heading: What kind of vehicles can you finance?
        rich_editor: Zeti supports the financing of zero or ultra-low emission vehicles
          across any industry including, but not limited, to taxi and rideshare;
          last-mile delivery, haulage and mass transit. Typically these vehicles
          are road vehicles but Zeti’s software can also support the financing
          of non-road vehicles as well as static assets. Contact us for more
          information.
      - heading: Can Zeti fund any vehicle?
        rich_editor: We will only support the funding of zero or ultra-low emission
          vehicles.
      - heading: What does Zeti's software do?
        rich_editor: Zeti’s patent-pending software is the automated asset financing
          platform that enables our pay-per-mile finance model. It handles all
          billing and payments, maps all assets, reports environmental benefits
          and provides online portals for both fleet operators and lenders. You
          will interact with our software through your Fleet Operator portal.
      - heading: Does Zeti finance consumers?
        rich_editor: Zeti does not provide its pay-per-mile product directly to
          consumers, yet! Stay tuned.
      - heading: How is the mileage monitored?
        rich_editor: The mileage is monitored via best-in-class telematics. Think of
          this as a ‘smart meter’ for a vehicle, which allows us to seamlessly
          measure usage without having to ask for odometer readings.
      - heading: Where does Zeti operate?
        rich_editor: Zeti is active and supporting the deployment of clean vehicles in
          Europe and the USA with offices in London, Los Angeles and New York;
          and with plans to expand further in the future.
      - heading: Where can I find more in-depth information about Zeti's products and
          services?
        rich_editor: If you’re a fleet operator, lender or manufacturer interested in
          learning more about Zeti, please get in touch with us via our [contact
