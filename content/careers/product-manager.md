#### **Company Overview**

Zeti (www.zeti.group) is an award-winning FinTech company which connects electric vehicle (‘EV’) fleet operators with institutional asset  and infrastructure lenders, providing flexible risk-adjusted finance and value-added data services to both. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption of ultra-low and zero emission connected transportation at scale through the digital transformation of the fleet financing process.

Founded in 2020 and headquartered in London, Zeti has enjoyed considerable early success, including graduating from the Accenture FinTech Innovation Lab, winning awards such as the CoMotion LA New Mobility Challenge and the 2022 Visa Everywhere Initiative for Europe, and raising funding from the likes of Powerhouse, Toyota Ventures and recently a £5m Series A investment from HYCAP.

Having established partnerships with several alternative lenders in the UK since 2020, we’ve deployed and now manage ~£30m of assets operating mostly in London, with around 4,500 vehicles in total on the platform. This has allowed us to help save around 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions and 29 tonnes of NOx emissions (at tailpipe) from equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles. All of this is facilitated via Zeti Hub, our proprietary integrated platform built on Microsoft Azure with customer-facing portals.

But the future ahead looks even more exciting at Zeti. We have a pipeline of >£400m of opportunities across UK, US & central Europe, and further business model diversification to apply the platform to other clean energy assets, such as renewable energy infrastructure. 

As a result, we’re looking to expand our passionate, committed team of  highly-skilled people to achieve these goals.
