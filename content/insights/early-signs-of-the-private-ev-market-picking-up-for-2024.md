[Hyundai and Kia](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/05/hyundai-and-kia-adopt-teslas-electric-vehicle-charging.html) have announced they will adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) (EV) charging system, from Q4 2024 onwards. All EVs produced in 2024 by the aforementioned OEMs will incorporate Tesla’s NACS technology, thus allowing drivers access to 12,000+ Tesla Superchargers across North America. Hyundai and Kia have joined other OEMs, such as Ford and GM, in adopting and integrating NACS technology which further strengthens Tesla’s market leadership in EV charging in this region. 

[Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-06/tesla-cuts-prices-of-model-3-y-in-us-after-quarterly-sales-miss?re_source=postr_story_0&sref=uFYGeRuc) has announced another round of price cuts, in the USA, to stimulate demand (arguably) driven by its modest Q3 results. Tesla has decreased the price of its base Model 3 by $1,250 to $38,990 and discounted the long-range version of the sedan by the same amount to $45,990. It has lowered the price of its performance version of the Model 3 by $2,250 to $50,990 and knocked $2,000 off the long-range and performance versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle, which now cost $48,490 and $52,490, respectively. Tesla hopes this will help it hit its target of selling 475,000 EVs in Q4, so the company can hit its overall 2023 sales target of 1.8m EVs. We believe that Tesla will hit its target, as production is ramping up in its new factories in Austin and (near) Berlin. Thus, giving the company a pricing, scalability and supply chain advantage compared to its peers. 

[Li Auto](https://cnevpost.com/2023/10/09/li-auto-completes-plant-capacity-upgrade/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) has announced it has completed manufacturing upgrades to its Changzhou factory. This will allow the company to deliver more than 40,000 EVs a month, which is a significant increase, as before the monthly capacity was around 35,000 EVs. These upgrades have positioned Li Auto to have a strong(er) Q4 and bear in mind the company has been on a 6-month consecutive hot streak in terms of delivery of EVs.

[Zapmap](https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/how-many-charging-points) has released data that states that the UK (as of Sept 2023) has 49,882 (43% increase YoY) public EV charging points, across 29,709 locations and if you factor in private charging points this figure skyrockets to c680,000. This is good news and has led to a cohort of industry experts stating that the UK is on track to hit its target of 300,00 public charging points by 2030. However, we believe that the UK government has to play a greater role if we are to hit this target by creating EV incentives. Furthermore, c46.5% of these public charge points are in Greater London and the Southeast whereas the Northeast, East Midlands and Yorkshire are considerably underserved. The government must play a role in making sure there is not a [geographical imbalance](https://www.edie.net/number-of-public-ev-charging-points-in-britain-soars-year-on-year/) in terms of public charging infrastructure.

[OVO](https://www.energylivenews.com/2023/10/11/ovo-offers-6000-free-ev-miles/) has announced it is partnering with Select Car Leasing to give EV drivers 6,000 miles of complimentary EV charging if they switch their home energy supply to OVO’s Charge Anytime EV add-on. This compelling incentive is priced competitively, at a rate of 3p per mile (= 10p per kWh), which is c2.6x more cost-effective than the national average (26p per kWh).

[VinFast](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/vietnam-ev-maker-vinfast-buy-battery-tech-firm-chairman-2023-10-11/) has announced it is strategically acquiring 99.8% of VinES, in order to secure its supply of batteries, which (over time) should help the company save 5-7% on battery costs. VinFast will be taking on $462m worth of debt however Mr Vuong will provide grants to VinFast for all interest payments relating to existing VinES borrowings, up to 2027. VinFast is following other OEMs, such as Ford, in attempting to bring as much of the EV supply chain in-house. It appears that VinFast may be able to move (slightly) faster (in the short term) in bringing parts of the supply chain in-house, due to Mr Vuong/Vingroup laying the foundations for VinFast.  

## Deals

[Metropolis](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/logistics-technology-firm-sp-plus-go-private-about-15-bln-deal-2023-10-05/), an American checkout-free parking startup, has announced raising $1.7bn in debt and equity to buy SP Plus.

This is a significant M&A deal, as the market has been very dry thus far, and this deal is the [biggest M&A transaction](https://news.crunchbase.com/transportation/metropolis-sp-plus-parking-acquisition/?utm_source=fot.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=trucks-fot-metropolis-cruise-tred) by a VC-backed company, so far this year.
